# A3C-for-Kung-Fu
ðŸ¥‹ A3C for Kung Fu

This project implements Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) to train an AI agent to play Kung Fu-style games. Using reinforcement learning, the agent learns to make strategic decisions in complex, dynamic game environments.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features

A3C reinforcement learning algorithm for efficient and stable training.

Supports dynamic environments with multiple actions and states.

Includes visualization tools to track agent performance during training.

Optimized for fast convergence and high game score performance.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Python, PyTorch / TensorFlow for RL implementation.

OpenAI Gym / Custom Game Environment for training scenarios.

NumPy and Matplotlib for data handling and visualization.

ðŸ”¹ Applications

Reinforcement learning research.

Game AI development.

Teaching AI agents strategic decision-making in dynamic environments.
